<h3 id="teamWork">You can always count on me
    when‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>you need any kind of support. Whether it‚Äôs emotional or technical. I
    may not know the solution to your problem, but I firmly believe that
    there is more knowledge in two (or more) heads than in one. So if you‚Äôre
    struggling, let‚Äôs do it and learn together!</p>
<h3 id="funnyStory">A funny story</h3>
<p>When I was in fifth grade, we used to play catch in the schoolyard.
    And our base was the wall. We just had to touch it to be safe. So one of
    my friends tried to catch me, and of course I ran like crazy towards
    that wall. Except I was a little too fast and couldn‚Äôt stop at the right
    time. You probably guessed it‚Ä¶ <strong>I ran straight into that
        wall</strong> and knocked myself out. Afterwards, I had a nice blue bump
    on my head and it looked like I had a unicorn horn growing.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>My friends still call me ‚ÄúLicorne‚Äù since that day.</p>
