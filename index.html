<p>you need any kind of support. Whether it‚Äôs emotional or technical. I
may not know the solution to your problem, but I firmly believe that
there is more knowledge in two (or more) heads than in one. So if you‚Äôre
struggling, let‚Äôs do it and learn together!</p>
<h3 id="a-funny-story">A funny story</h3>
<p>When I was in fifth grade, we used to play catch in the schoolyard.
And our base was the wall. We just had to touch it to be safe. So one of
my friends tried to catch me, and of course I ran like crazy towards
that wall. Except I was a little too fast and couldn‚Äôt stop at the right
time. You probably guessed it‚Ä¶ <strong>I ran straight into that
wall</strong> and knocked myself out. Afterwards, I had a nice blue bump
on my head and it looked like I had a unicorn horn growing.</p>
<h4 id="tldr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>My friends still call me ‚ÄúLicorne‚Äù since that day.</p>
